OSRS-Refactored

OSRS-Refactored is a personal project to help demonstrate the usefulness of reverse engineering and understanding the protocol of the OldSchool Runescape Client. 
This is a deobfuscated and refactored version of revision 60 of the OSRS client. Please only use this for reference and education!

I tried to give credit where credit was due and hopefully I'll have a fully refactored osrs client soon. Feel free to make contributions.
